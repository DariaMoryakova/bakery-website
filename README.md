# Bakery Website

 This is a fullstack bakery website that displays information about cookies, cakes and muffins offered for sale as well as enables someone to receive a catalog of items sold via email.

## Client Suggestions:

Client wants it to look and feel like a bakery website. 
The front page should provide information about the bakery
have links to pages where you can see:
all cookies
all cakes
all muffins
Each item sold should have
a name
a description
There should be a way for a person on the site to receive an email with a catalog of all items sold

## Technology used:

For front-end:

I am using HTML,CSS,Javascript and Materialize library to style the website. Even though, I used materialize libary,my website looks very authentic, because I made a lot of changes to the website by rewritting Materizlise styles with plain CSS. To make cakes,cookies and cupcakes rander on the page I used Javascript and DOM manipulation. As you can go on the order page you can see those randering are all dynamic.

For back-end:

I am using Sinatra microframework. I also, use the Sendgrid API to send an email to the userï¿½s email with a catalog of all items sold.
